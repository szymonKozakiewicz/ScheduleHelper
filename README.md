#Daily Schedule Generator
## Project Description
The "Daily Schedule Generator" project is an application designed to assist in organizing daily routines by generating a schedule based on user-inputted data. The application allows users to specify a task list, allocate time for each task, set a starting time, indicate whether a task is a break, and provide the option for tasks to repeat. It also enables real-time editing during the day.

## Features
1. Task Addition:

	* Users can add tasks to the list, specifying the time required for each task.
	* The option to set a starting time and designate whether the task is a break.
	* Ability to determine whether a task should repeat after completing all other tasks.
2. Daily Schedule Generation:

	* Based on the provided input, the application generates a daily plan, considering the time the user wants to allocate for each task.
3. Real-Time Editing:

	* Users can make edits to the plan during the day.
	* The ability to shift tasks in case of non-completion, with automatic adjustment of the remaining tasks.
